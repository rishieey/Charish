      <h3>Team Work</h3>
      <p>Teamwork brings people together (the bonding agent) and motivates them to rely on one another to get things done. Teamwork also makes progress easier (the lubrication) and allows the group to overcome obstacles that would have stymied an individual. Without teamwork, none of that would be possible.</p>

      <h3>Leadership</h3>
      <p>Valuable leadership skills include the ability to delegate, inspire and communicate effectively. Other leadership traits include honesty, confidence, commitment and creativity. In IT, executives are often required to be jacks-of-all-trades.</p>

      <h3>Interpersonal Skills</h3>
      <p>Interpersonal skills are an essential capability in effective leadership. With these skills, leaders can better motivate their team, encourage collaboration, and foster stronger engagement, all of which ultimately contribute to an organization's success.</p>

      <h3>Communication Skills</h3>
      <p>Being able to communicate effectively is perhaps the most important of all life skills. It is what enables us to pass information to other people, and to understand what is said to us. You only have to watch a baby listening intently to its mother and trying to repeat the sounds that she makes to understand how fundamental is the urge to communicate.
